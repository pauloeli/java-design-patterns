# Java Design Patterns

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

I wrote this examples some time ago to study GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns applied in Java. Nowadays,
I updated the code for more recent Java version and for purpose to versionate, I shared with someone who has interest.

Basically, the all examples in this project are copied/implemented from [Java Design Patterns](https://java-design-patterns.com/)
(credits for them). Some of them was incomplete in the original page, so, I implemented some parts and make some changes.  

**Disclaimer:** exists more efficient ways and methods to do the examples, but I chose the vanilla way for better
understanding.

You can find explanation about the patterns in these pages:

- [Java Design Patterns](https://java-design-patterns.com/)
- [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/java)

Have fun!
